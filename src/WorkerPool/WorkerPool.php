/**
 * Aegis-managed worker pool primitive.
 *
 * Wraps `OpenSwoole\Core\Process\Manager` (which itself composes
 * `OpenSwoole\Process\Pool`) with a typed Phalanx-native facade. The
 * existing `Phalanx\Hydra\Agent\Worker` request/response IPC serves
 * service-call workloads; this WorkerPool targets the simpler "spawn N
 * processes that run a function and stay alive under a supervisor" use
 * case (plx-ops background workers, scheduled job pools, fan-out batch
 * processors).
 *
 * The C-level supervisor restarts crashed workers automatically; the
 * pool propagates SIGTERM/SIGINT to children via Process\Pool's built-in
 * signal handling. No PHP-level child-tracking is needed.
 *
 * Lifecycle: construct, add() one or more worker functions, then start().
 * `start()` blocks the calling process — workers run until the master
 * receives a termination signal. For embedding inside an Aegis bundle
 * with onShutdown registration, build the WorkerPool from a service
 * factory and call start() from the application entry point.
